# Neural Networks

### Projects

These projects are made with the javascript Toy Neural Network library, which you can
find [HERE](https://github.com/CodingTrain/toy-neural-network-js/),
> by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman/).

And I am also using the [Processing](https://processing.org)'s javascript framework which is
called [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
