# Animation

## Description

This is a project that I'm doing for fun. My goal is to make something somewhat like an animation library,   
inspired by [p5.js](https://p5js.org) from [Processing](https://processing.org).   
You can also find it on github: [Processing GitHub](https://github.com/Processing)

## TODOs:
1. Functions:
   * cosine
   * finish fill and background
   * ellipse
   * rectMode
